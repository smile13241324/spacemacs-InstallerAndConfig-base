# spacemacs-InstallerAndConfig-Haskell

This is a integrated spacemacs development environment containing a full fledged
Haskell environment, with a preinstalled `Hie` executable for lsp integration.

This has been separated from the [main image](https://github.com/smile13241324/spacemacs-InstallerAndConfig) due
to increasing build times for the Haskell dependencies.

If you are not interested in Haskell development it would be best to use the base image.
