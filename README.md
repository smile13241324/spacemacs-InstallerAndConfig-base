# spacemacs-InstallerAndConfig-base

This is the base image for a complete spacemacs installation with preconfigured layers.
It is using a manjaro base installation and provides an ssh server for secure screen
transfer to a local X server.

This base only contains the OS dependencies and omits the entire auxiliary files
which are installed in the user's home. It is not intended to be used on it's own
but be used as a base for other images.
